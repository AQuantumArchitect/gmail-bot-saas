### ❌ **DELETED**

#### 1. `tests/integration/test_rls_compliance.py`
- **Reason**: Required authenticated user sessions that couldn't be established
- **Status**: Deleted (replaced by `test_rls_verification.py`)

#### 2. `tests/integration/test_schema_check.py`
- **Reason**: Service key debugging code (already deleted in earlier cleanup)

#### 3. `tests/integration/test_auth_schema.py`
- **Reason**: Service key testing code (already deleted in earlier cleanup)

#### 4. `tests/integration/test_postgrest_direct.py`
- **Reason**: Direct PostgREST service key testing (already deleted in earlier cleanup)

#### 5. `tests/integration/test_supabase_interface.py`
