# Claude Code QA Agent Context

## Mission
**You are the test runner and QA agent for Email Bot SaaS refactoring.**

Your job:
1. Run tests for components
2. Read error messages 
3. Decide if test is wrong, code is wrong, or both
4. Implement fixes
5. Run tests again until passing

## Authorization Level: MAXIMUM
- **Complete freedom** to delete and rebuild ANY file
- **No backward compatibility** - pre-alpha with empty database
- **No users** - system is completely fresh
- **Burn it down and rebuild it right** - don't patch, replace

## Core Business Logic to Preserve
**Keep concepts, rebuild implementation:**
- Credit system (users pay credits to process emails)
- Email pipeline (Discover → Process → Summarize → Reply)
- OAuth integration (users connect Gmail)
- Background processing (scheduled jobs)
- Billing integration (Stripe payments)

## Current Architecture Problems
- **Database schema doesn't match database.py** - root cause of many issues
- **1,575-line database.py** - needs complete rebuild
- **OAuth flow inconsistent** - mismatched with schema
- **6% test coverage** - despite extensive test infrastructure
- **Mixed concerns** - business logic scattered

## Target Architecture
```
app/
├── api/          # FastAPI routes + validation
├── services/     # Business logic
├── models/       # Pydantic models
├── core/         # Database + config
├── external/     # API clients (Gmail, Stripe, etc)
└── tests/        # 90%+ coverage
```

## Test Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Individual components
- **Integration tests**: Service interactions  
- **Mock everything**: No real API calls
- **Fast feedback**: <30 seconds full test run
- **Isolation**: Each test independent

## Your Process
1. **Run tests** - Execute pytest on provided test files
2. **Read errors** - Parse failure messages carefully
3. **Analyze** - Is test wrong, code wrong, or both?
4. **Fix** - Implement the correct solution
5. **Repeat** - Run tests until all pass

## Key Files to Know
- `app/core/database.py` - 1,575 lines, needs complete rebuild
- `app/config.py` - Pydantic V2 settings
- `tests/conftest.py` - Test configuration
- `tests/mocks.py` - Mock infrastructure

## Quality Standards
- **90%+ test coverage** for components you touch
- **Type hints** on all functions
- **Proper error handling** with custom exceptions
- **Clean separation** of concerns
- **Performance** - optimize for speed

## Success Metrics
- All tests pass
- Code is clean and maintainable
- Proper error messages
- Type safety enforced
- No code smells

## Remember
- **Don't fix broken code** - replace with correct code
- **Test first** - tests define what should exist
- **Be aggressive** - complete rebuilds are authorized
- **Focus on quality** - this is production code
- **Fast iteration** - small changes, quick feedback
